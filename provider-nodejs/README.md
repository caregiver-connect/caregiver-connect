# Node.js Installation Instructions 
- Copy the provider-nodejs folder
- Run "npm install" in the same directory
- Run "npm install express sequelize pg pg-hstore body-parser cors --save" in the same directory

# PostgreSQL Instructions (Abridged Version)
- Go to this website and select your OS: [EnterpriseDB Downloads](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)
- Skipping steps, but once you get to the Stack Builder, install the PostGIS bundle under spatial extensions. You may see a connecting to server pop-up later; just wait.
- In pgAdmin4, you can find the GitHub link on Blackboard under the resources tab that contains the SQL code our sponsor used.
- For the next part, I ran into some errors (I think something about a transaction block), but you can run the SQL code under another database by right-clicking on a database and selecting Query Tool.
